# Python Compiler

This project aims to use Python's bytecode to build a transpiler (that converts it to Rust), where it can then be compiled to an executable

# **Warning**
This repo is being rewritten!!!
It takes about 5 minutes of actual reading to see that the structure I chose for this project wasn't going to be sustainable at scale, so I've restarted with a hopefully better method. Please see [the new repo here](https://github.com/definiteconfusion/python-compiler)
