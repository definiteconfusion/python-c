# Stack Visualization

### Stack
`LOAD_GLOBAL` -> Loads the function (in this case `print`) to the stack  
`LOAD_CONST` -> Loads the value to be passed (in this case `"Hello World!"`) to the stack  
`CALL` -> calls the function loaded to the stack with arguments as loaded under it in the stack  
`POP_TOP` -> clears the stack for the next expression
